Open Lore License v1.0 – Create your own at http://openlorelicense.com/

“Baby Bird Edition”

Preamble The Open Lore License (OLL) is a hybrid licensing model designed to foster innovation and protect foundational intellectual property. Inspired by the metaphor of a mother bird guiding her hatchlings, OLL supports new ventures during their most fragile stages, offering a safe and open nest to build, learn, and grow. But once flight is achieved and sustainable revenue is earned, it is time to engage in fair licensing and mutual benefit.
This license is granted for the use of the LoreTokens individual parts and overall Ecosystem, including SAIQL & Lorechain, a system for cognitive compression and memory management in artificial intelligence, as defined in USPTO Provisional Patent Application: System and Method for Hierarchical, Persistent, and Contextual AI Memory and Lore Management.
We believe open access leads to extraordinary progress—but innovation should also be respected. This license ensures small developers and startups can freely experiment, while large-scale commercial entities contribute fairly to the ecosystem they benefit from.

•	Licensee: Any person or organization using LoreTokens or equivalent systems.
•	Gross Revenue: Total revenue received by the Licensee from products or services incorporating LoreTokens or derivative technology.
________________________________________
2. Grant of License Subject to the terms herein, this license allows:
•	Free usage of LoreTokens-based systems by individuals, non-profits, and businesses generating less than $6 million USD in gross revenue.
•	Continued free usage in a Grace Period from $6M up to $10 million USD, provided the Licensee:
o	Notifies the rights holder upon crossing the $6M threshold
o	Begins commercial licensing discussions within a reasonable timeframe (suggested: 12 months)
________________________________________
3. Commercial License Requirement Any Licensee exceeding $10 million USD in gross revenue must obtain a commercial license to continue using LoreTokens or derivative works.
________________________________________
4. Corporate Restriction Clause This license does not apply to any entity that:
•	Is majority-owned, funded, or operated by a company earning over $10 million USD annually
•	Was formed as a subsidiary, shell company, or affiliate to circumvent this license's intent
•	Was formed as a subsidiary, shell company, or affiliate that could circumvent this license's intent
________________________________________
5. Ethical Use Encouraged The spirit of this license encourages:
•	Transparent development
•	Attribution of the LoreTokens system
•	Prohibition of weaponized or exploitative AI systems built on this framework
________________________________________
6. Revocation and Enforcement This license may be revoked if:
•	A Licensee willfully misrepresents their revenue or ownership status
•	A violation of ethical clauses or misuse is confirmed
Rights holders retain the authority to pursue commercial licensing or enforcement as permitted by law.
________________________________________
7. Attribution Any public implementation must include visible or accessible attribution referencing: "Powered by LoreTokens – Cognitive Compression for AI."
________________________________________
8. Modifications and Successors Future versions of the Open Lore License may be issued. Licensees may choose to adopt the latest version or remain under v1.0.
________________________________________
9. Big Bird Addendum – Anti-Monopoly Clause Entities exceeding $1 billion USD in annual revenue, or entities deemed to hold significant market dominance in the field of artificial intelligence, cognitive memory systems, or symbolic compression technology, are subject to the following additional restrictions:
•	May not request or obtain exclusive licensing to LoreTokens or its derivatives.
•	May not use LoreTokens-derived systems to impose exclusivity on users, clients, or third-party developers.
•	May not acquire smaller companies solely for the purpose of consolidating LoreTokens-based IP under monopolistic control.
•	Any acquisition of a company or IP portfolio reliant on LoreTokens technology must be reported to the rights holder and may require license review and approval. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, except in cases of unethical consolidation, exclusivity enforcement, or known harm to the open AI ecosystem.
•	Must publish a summary of how LoreTokens or derivatives are integrated into their systems upon request.
•	May not file derivative patents based on LoreTokens architecture or function without explicit, licensed permission.
Violations of the Big Bird Addendum may result in revocation of licensing rights, publication of the violation, and coordination with standards bodies or public registries to flag noncompliant actors.

Why OLL?
The Open Lore License (OLL) sits between permissive and copyleft models. It lets teams use and ship their own products freely at lower gradients while reserving the deepest LoreToken/gradient tech for partners who maintain credit and feed improvements back. Standard MIT/Apache/GPL licenses don’t speak to semantic continuity or compression tiers, so OLL was shaped specifically for projects that need flexible tiers.

Comparison with common licenses:
- MIT/BSD/Apache: Fully permissive, minimal obligations. Great for generic libraries, but nothing stops large vendors from strip-mining semantic IP without attribution. OLL adds gradient tiers and LoreToken safeguards so early-stage teams keep leverage.
- GPL/AGPL: Strong copyleft keeps contributions flowing, but the viral nature discourages enterprise adoption and doesn’t address compression disclosure. OLL uses a stair-step model: L1–L3 fully permissive, higher gradients require credit/partnering, avoiding full copyleft friction.
- Commercial-only: Locks down everything and slows adoption. OLL deliberately leaves entry tiers free/open so developers can prototype, while deeper gradients remain protected until trust is established.

In short, OLL keeps the openness of MIT for base features, adds gradient-aware tiers to guard the unique compression/continuity tech, and avoids the enterprise drawbacks of GPL/AGPL. It fits semantic databases like SAIQL where we want rapid adoption without handing over the exact IP that makes the system valuable.
