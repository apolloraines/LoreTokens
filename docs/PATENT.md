# LoreToken Patent + Licensing Overview

LoreTokens™ and the surrounding ecosystem (SAIQL™, LT-RAM, LTTPS, and related cognitive-compression technologies) are covered by the **System and Method for Hierarchical, Persistent, and Contextual AI Memory and Lore Management** patent family. The technology stack includes:

- **SAIQL (Semantic Artificial Query Language)** – symbolic database/query engine
- **LoreTokens** – symbolic/standard/ultra serialization formats
- **LT-RAM / LTTPS** – LoreToken RAM pipelines and LoreToken Transport Protocol Stack
- **Loretoken-GPU** – CUDA hooks for semantic compression
- Any derived compression/semantic memory modules originating from this ecosystem

These components are governed by the **Open Lore License (OLL)**. The TL;DR:

| Annual revenue | Terms |
| --- | --- |
| `< $6M` | Free to use, fork, and build upon LoreTokens/SAIQL with attribution. |
| `$6M – $10M` | Free grace period, but notify rights holder (apollo@saiql.ai) upon crossing $6M and begin licensing discussions within ~12 months. |
| `> $10M` | Commercial license required. Contact apollo@saiql.ai for terms. |

Additional rules (see `docs/LICENSE.txt` for the full text):

- Corporate restriction clause prevents large parents from spinning subsidiaries purely to bypass the thresholds.
- “Big Bird” addendum blocks monopolistic behavior and derivative-patent grabs from >$1B revenue entities.
- Ethical-use and attribution clauses apply (“Powered by LoreTokens – Cognitive Compression for AI”).
